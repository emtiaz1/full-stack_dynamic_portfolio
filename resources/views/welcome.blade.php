    Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
    I'm Emtiaz Ahmed, and I'm excited to share my work with you. This portfolio showcases the projects, skills, and ideas I've developed over time â€” from web development and programming to research and innovation.

<p>
    Feel free to explore, learn more about what I do, and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or just have a chat. Thanks for stopping by!
